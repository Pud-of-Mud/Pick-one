# Pick one.
A completely standalone minimalist webpage template of a choice: to choose between Red and Blue. Inspired by the Matrix films.
<br> <br>
This project is all contained within one .html file, no dependencies or external files are required. 

## How it works
* When the user click on the **Blue** button, it activates the JavaScript function ```redirectWithMaliciousIntent()```.
* When the user clicks on the **Red** button, it triggers the JavaScript function ```redirectWithBenevolentIntent()```.
<br>
Feel free to change what these functions do, as I currently have them set to placeholders. Let your imagination run wild!
